## ICICLE  
**ICICLE** is the backbone of Ingonyamaâ€™s approach to ZK acceleration. It is a powerful, backend-agnostic, cross-language cryptography library that serves as the engine for building Zero-knowledge provers and other advanced cryptographic applications. Its modular design allows seamless integration with various frameworks through dedicated repositories.
